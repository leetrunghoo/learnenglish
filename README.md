# Learn English
This is a web app for learning English that I made for personal use. I would like to share it to everyone, hope it helps.

## About the project:
- Firsly I need the content for my web app so I wrote a simple crawler/scraper runs on nodejs to scrape the data from <http://www.talkenglish.com>
- I want to keep this project simple so currently I'm just using Jquery, Materializecss, Masonry and Handlebar for building the web app.

## How to run

Requirement: nodejs & npm

Install all dependencies
```
npm install
```

Then run gulp task
```
gulp
```
