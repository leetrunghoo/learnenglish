    "html": "\r\n<h1>\r\nPerformance Review Period\r\n</h1>\r\nA performance review period is a time when your manager reviews your work and tells you where you need to improve or where you have been doing well. &#xA0;Some smaller companies do not have a concrete review process. &#xA0;But large companies have a process in place. &#xA0;Some of them do a review two times a year, and some companies have a yearly review. &#xA0;Your review is sometimes dependent on how much raise you will get and sometimes even the bonus amount.<br><br>Because the review is different from company to company, I will use this lesson for sentences you need to say during the time you speak with your manager. &#xA0;I will not be going into the details and timeframe of the review.<br><br>If there is a process in place, then you probably have a template to write down your achievements over a certain time span. &#xA0;This is your chance to toot your own horn. &#xA0;So include everything you did and do not be modest. &#xA0;If you don&apos;t have a template to follow, then write down on a word document the achievements you made. &#xA0;It is also good to write down some places where you want to improve. &#xA0;Some people might think that telling your manager where you need to improve is basically admitting to having flaws, but great managers think a person who can identify their own problems and fix them are great employees.\r\n"
