What is your favorite hobby?&quot;<br>B: &quot;Probably sports.&quot;<br>A: &quot;Anything specific? Or just sports in general.&quot;<br>B: &quot;Most sports. I like basketball, football, baseball, golf, tennis, so I guess most sports.&quot;<br>A: &quot;I like tennis. Did you play for your high school team?&quot;<br>B: &quot;Yeah. I played on the varsity team starting from my sophomore year. How about you?&quot;<br>A: &quot;I played my junior and senior year.&quot;<br>B: &quot;What other sports did you play?&quot;<br>A: &quot;I played volleyball. I would have to say volleyball is my favorite.&quot;<br>B: &quot;What position did you play?&quot;<br>A: &quot;I was the outside hitter.&quot;<br>B: &quot;That&apos;s so cool. I didn&apos;t know you were athletic.&quot;<br>A: &quot;I don&apos;t know if I would consider myself athletic, but I have fun playing.&quot;<br>B: &quot;I play on a co-ed volleyball team every Tuesdays. We&apos;re always looking for more girls to play on our team. Would you be interested?&quot;<br>A: &quot;Yeah. It sounds fun. Just call me anytime you need a player.&quot;<br>B: &quot;That&apos;s great. Since we are on the topic of sports, what sport do you like to watch on television?&quot;<br>A: &quot;I never got into watching sports on TV. So I really don&apos;t know.&quot;<br>B: &quot;Not even the Super bowl?&quot;<br>A: &quot;Only when the group of people I&apos;m with is watching it. I just never had interest in TV that much.&quot;<br>B: &quot;Well, I like following the Mariners. They&apos;re pretty good.&quot;<br>A: &quot;I like to go watch them play. It&apos;s fun when you are actually there.&quot;<br>B: &quot;A bunch of us are going to watch them play this June. Do you want to join us?&quot;<br>A: &quot;Yeah. I&apos;ll go. I like the new stadium. It&apos;s pretty cool.&quot;<br>B: &quot;Ok.
