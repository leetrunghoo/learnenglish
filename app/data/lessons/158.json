    "html": "\r\n<h1>\r\nRoommate - Sharing things and Questions\r\n</h1>\r\nSometimes a roommate will bring a mini refrigerator, or it might turn out that you will. &#xA0;It&apos;s polite to let your roommate use the refrigerator too.<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L53/sentence/L53S1.mp3\">Feel free to use the refrigerator.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L53/sentence/L53S2.mp3\">Can I put my drinks in your fridge?</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L53/sentence/L53S3.mp3\">Do you mind if I use your refrigerator?</a>&quot;<br><br>If you connect with the person and you become friends, then you will not even need to ask. &#xA0;For example, after you get to know the person your comments will be different. &#xA0;Say I become a friend of my roommate. &#xA0;And then after a month or so, he brings a refrigerator. &#xA0;I wouldn&apos;t ask to use it, I would rather comment on how useful it will be. &#xA0;It&apos;s assumed that a friend can use the refrigerator, so no need to sound weird by asking politely. &#xA0;Instead you can say,<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L53/sentence/L53S4.mp3\">Cool, you brought a fridge. &#xA0;I can go buy milk now.</a>&quot;<br><br>This comment is saying that you appreciate the refrigerator by saying, &apos;cool&apos;, then you indicate that you are going to use it by saying you will buy milk. &#xA0;If your friend doesn&apos;t object to your comment, then it is the same thing as getting permission to use the refrigerator.<br><br><b>Responding to questions</b><br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L53/sentence/L53S5.mp3\">Are you a night person or a morning person?</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L53/sentence/L53S6.mp3\">I&apos;m a night owl. &#xA0;I usually sleep pretty late.</a>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L53/sentence/L53S7.mp3\">What time do you usually go to sleep?</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L53/sentence/L53S8.mp3\">It varies. &#xA0;Usually between midnight and one in the morning.</a>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L53/sentence/L53S9.mp3\">What time do you usually wake up?</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L53/sentence/L53S10.mp3\">I don&apos;t wake up until I have to.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L53/sentence/L53S11.mp3\">I usually wake up at nine in the morning.</a>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L53/sentence/L53S12.mp3\">Does the music bother you?</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L53/sentence/L53S13.mp3\">No not at all. &#xA0;I like it.</a>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L53/sentence/L53S14.mp3\">Do you mind if I turn the stereo on?</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L53/sentence/L53S15.mp3\">Oh, feel free.</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L53/sentence/L53S16.mp3\">Can I put my drinks in your fridge?</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L53/sentence/L53S17.mp3\">Sure. &#xA0;Don&apos;t worry about it.</a>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L53/sentence/L53S18.mp3\">Do you mind if I use your refrigerator?</a>&quot;<br>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.talkenglish.com/AudioTE1/L53/sentence/L53S19.mp3\">No problem at all.</a>&quot;\r\n"
